Strategy description.
  Our strategy is very simple; we simply traverse all the hosts once using a fixed,
  hardcoded path. This path ensures that the bot will not run into any walls.
  Steven calculated and coded the path for the right part of the map, and 
  Rem calculated and coded the path for the left part of the map and wrote a small
  function to move (in a straight line) to a point.
