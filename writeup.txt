Strategy description.
  Our strategy is very simple; we simply traverse all the hosts once using a fixed,
  hardcoded path. This path ensures that the bot will not run into any walls.
  We originally wanted to have a strategy that continually searched for the closest
  host and go to that host and shoot it. However, our current method of moving makes it
  so that the bot gets stuck if there is a wall in the straight-line path to the host.
  Therefore, we decided to simply hardcode a hand-calculated path instead.
  Steven calculated and coded the path for the right part of the map, and 
  Rem calculated and coded the path for the left part of the map and wrote a small
  function to move (in a straight line) to a point.
